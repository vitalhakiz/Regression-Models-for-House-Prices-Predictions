# Regression-Models-for-House-Prices-Predictions
Generally, buying a house depends on some important features like number of rooms, square feet, locations etc. In this view, buyers should expect to have some knowledge of predictions before buying the house to avoid high cost. Therefore, this project intend to build regressions models that generates predictions on the cost of the house depending on different features. This a project which is available on Kaggle competion. My objective was to build regression models and submit the predictions on kaggle competition to see the scores for each model
